What is it?
===========

noice is a small ncurse-based file manager.
It was first developped to be used with a tv remote control for a media center
solution.

Getting started
===============

Get the latest version from the git-repository; build and install it.
Run noice in a directory to display its content in the form of a list, where
each line is a file or direcotry. The currently selected item will be preceded
with a " > " by default.

Navigation
----------

You can navigate the list using the following keybinds (hardcoded):

+------+-------+-------+---------------------------------------------------
| k    | UP    | ^P    | go up
| j    | DOWN  | ^N    | go down
|      | PGUP  | ^U    | go up (fast)
|      | PGDN  | ^D    | go down (fast)
| l    | RIGHT | ^M    | open file / directory (see section "File opening")
| h    | LEFT  | ^?    | navigate up one directory
| /    | &     |       | filter output
| q    |       |       | exit program
| !    |       |       | spawn shell in current directory
+------+-------+-------+---------------------------------------------------

File opening
------------

Depending on the filetype, noice will open the selected file with the
application specified in `config.h` at compilation time. The associations
specified are regexes, so you might experience issues when trying to open a file
that do not match those regexes.

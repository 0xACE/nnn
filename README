What is it?
===========

noice is a small ncurses-based file browser.
It was first developed to be used with a tv remote control for a media
center solution.


Getting started
===============

Get the latest version from the git-repository; build and install it.  Run
noice in a directory to display its content in the form of a list, where
each line is a file or directory.  The currently selected item will be
preceded with a " > " by default.

For more information refer to the manpage.

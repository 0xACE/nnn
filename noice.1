.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm noice
.Op Ar dir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple and efficient file manager that gets out of your way
as much as possible.  It was initially implemented to be controlled
with a TV remote control.
.Pp
.Nm
supports both vi-like and emacs-like key bindings in the default
configuration.  The default key bindings are described below;
their functionality is described in more detail later.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "h | Left | BackspaceXXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Ic k | Up | C-p

.It Ic j | Down | C-n
Move to next entry.
.It Ic Pgup | C-u
Scroll backwards one page.
.It Ic Pgdown | C-d
Scroll forwards one page.
.It Ic l | Right | C-m
Open file or enter directory.
.It Ic h | Left | Backspace
Back up one directory level.
.It Ic / | &
Filter view (see below for more details).
.It Ic !

.Nm .
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
is configured by modifying
.Pa config.h
and recompiling the code.
.Pp
The file associations are specified by regexes
matching on the currently selected filename.  If a match is found the associated
program is executed with the filename passed in as the argument.  If no match
is found the program less(1) is invoked.  This is useful for editing text files
as one can use the 'v' command in less(1) to edit the file in $EDITOR.
.Pp
See the examples section below for more information.
.Sh FILTERS
Filters allow you to use regexes to display only the matched
entries in the current directory view.  This effectively allows
searching through the directory tree for a particular entry.
.Pp
Filters do not stack on top of each other.  They are applied anew
every time.
.Pp
To reset the filter you can use the match-any regex (i.e. '.').
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows one possible configuration for
file associations.  This is the default configuration for
.Nm .
.Bd -literal
struct assoc assocs[] = {
        { "\\.(avi|mp4|mkv|mp3|ogg|flac)$", "mplayer" },
        { "\\.(png|jpg|gif)$", "feh" },
        { "\\.(html|svg)$", "firefox" },
        { "\\.pdf$", "mupdf" },
        { "\\.sh$", "sh" },
        { ".*", "less" },
};
